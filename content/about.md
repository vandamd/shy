## About

Born in Britain but deeply rooted in her Tamil Sri Lankan heritage, Shynootha Shyamsunthar stands at the crossroads of cultural fusion, a motif that infuses every stitch and print of her designs. Currently pursuing her studies at Central Saint Martins with a focus on Print design, Shynootha's creative journey is a tapestry woven with threads of tradition and innovation.

Drawing inspiration from her upbringing in Liverpool, she orchestrates a symphony of colours and fine details in her prints, each piece a testament to her multifaceted identity. Through the lens of her Eastern heritage, Shynootha explores the intricate dance between embroidery, illustration, and draping, infusing her creations with a harmony of textures and silhouettes.

Delving into the realms of science for inspiration, she intertwines artistic expression with technical precision, forging a unique amalgamation for her designs. Her repertoire of techniques spans from traditional screen printing, digital sublimation, and sustainable approaches to printing and dyeing.

Influenced by surrealist art movements and vibrant colour palettes, Shynootha's designs are a celebration of the surreal beauty found in the convergence of cultures. With each collection, she invites us to embark on a visual odyssey, where tradition and modernity intertwine to redefine the boundaries of contemporary fashion.
