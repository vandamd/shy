## Balenciaga

### Final Design

### Research
Starting with a visit to the Cristóbal Balenciaga Museo in Bilbao, this project was greatly inspired by Balenciaga’s designs; particularly his interest in honouring his Spanish heritage.

This led Shynootha to think about dances in her culture such as Bharatanatyam and Kathak. In her research, she delves into the overlap between Flamenco, Bharatanatyam and Balenciaga’s silhouettes.

### Development

### Process
After multiple toiles, Shynootha was satisfied with the fit and silhouette of her garment. However, due to the lightweight nature of the saree fabric, the actual fabric itself needed amending - this was particularly difficult as the saree fabric was not only lightweight but non-fusible as it was translucent. Therefore, the jacket would have 4 and 7 layers in specific areas such as the chest.
